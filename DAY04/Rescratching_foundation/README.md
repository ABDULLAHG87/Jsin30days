## DAY04: RESCATCHING THE FOUNDATION CHALLENGE

## CURRENT DATE: 
**2nd June, 2024**

## GOAL/FOCUS OF THE DAY
`What are your major goals or focused for today?`
Today, I am stretching my muscle to do the unthinkable of reviewing and re-stratching the surface for two prominents programming Languages which are: Python and JavaScript

The foundations for both languages have somethings in common, and so i think reviewing both will help.

## TIME SPENT:
`write down estimated time spent in learning`

## MY ACHIEVEMENT/TOPICS COVERED
`What are your acheivements/ topic covered?, include links to resources used`


## CHALLENGE FACED
```What are the challenges faced while learning and how did you solved it ? What are specific aspect or topics your find dificult to understand?Mention error encountered while coding and how you solved it```




## LEARNINGS/DEDUCTIONS
`While learning or performing your daily task what are concepts, facts learned?`

## There are 7 primitive Datatypes for JavaScript which are:
* **Boolean:** 
  ```javaScript
  let isPassword = true;
  let isNumber = False;
  ```
* **String:**
  ```javaScript
   let str1 = 'welcome'; //String can be enclosed in single quote 
   const day = "Tuesday"; //Strings can come in Double quotes
   let message = `Today is ${day}` //Backtick or Template Literal
* **Number:**
  ```javaScript
  const PI = 3.142
  let age = 34;
  ```
* **Null:**
  ```javaScript
  //Null is refered used to denote empty array or objects 
  let score = [] // Here score is null
  ```
